Use GMap2.getBounds() to find the bounding box. 
The use GLatLngBounds.containsLatLng() to check each marker to see if it is visible.

Alternatively you could try and use the same approach with the 
Marker Cluster if the value of each cluster is stored in an easily 
accessible way. (haven't looked myself)
